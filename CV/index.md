### BIOGRAPHY 
Dr. Linley Li Lin is currently an Assistant Professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). She received her B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from SJTU and worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and SJTU. Her academic research is primarily in the area of plasmonic nanostructures, nanomedicine, and image-guided surgery. During her PhD and Postdoctoral research, she was one of the principal researchers of GERTs - a novel SERS nanotag with ultra-high sensitivity, uniformity, and photostability. Her current research interests include deep Raman techniques, surface-enhanced Raman scattering bioimaging, and Raman spectroscopic platform to study biomaterial interfaces. She has developed in vivo transmission Raman spectroscopy techniques for deep Raman imaging and three-dimensional tomography. Her team's pioneering works include the highest Raman optical detection depth (over 10 cm) in ex vivo biological tissues, and for the first-time the non-invasive localization of in vivo deep-seated lesions on live big animal models using deep Raman spectroscopy. She has published over 30 journal papers, with the citations of more than 1200 and H-index of 15. Dr. Lin has received a number of awards, including the Shanghai Chenguang Young Scholar Program (2021) and the Best Paper Award at the IMCO International Conference (2019).

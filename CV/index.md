### BIOGRAPHY 
Dr. Linley Li Lin is currently an associate professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). She received her B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from SJTU and conducted her postdoctoral fellow at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and SJTU. Her academic research is primarily in the area of plasmonic nanostructures, nanomedicine, and image-guided surgery. During her PhD and Postdoctoral research, she was one of the principal researchers of GERTs - a novel SERS nanotag with ultra-high sensitivity, uniformity, and photostability. Her current research interests include deep Raman techniques, surface-enhanced Raman scattering bioimaging, and Raman spectroscopic platform to study biomaterial interfaces. She has developed in vivo transmission Raman spectroscopy techniques for deep Raman imaging and three-dimensional tomography. Her team's pioneering works include the Deep Raman optical detection through biological tissues, and for the first-time the non-invasive localization of in vivo deep-seated lesions on live big animal models using deep Raman spectroscopy. Dr. Lin has received a number of awards, including the Shanghai Chenguang Young Scholar Program (2021) and the Best Paper Award at the IMCO International Conference (2019).

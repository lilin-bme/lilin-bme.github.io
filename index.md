## Welcome to Nanooptics and Raman Sensing Lab (LIN LAB AT SJTU)

The interface between light and materials creates unique optical properties at the nanoscale, enabling the manipulation and transport of light in a controlled manner. With the use of nanomaterial tools, we can study the interaction of biological molecules, cells, or tissues with optical nanostructures. <br> 

{% capture text %}

We use state-of-the-art nanofabrication and simulation technologies to design and fabricate plasmonic nanostructures as ultrasensitive nanosensors for trace detection. In particular, we have focused on surface-enhanced Raman scattering as a bioimaging modality for in vivo surgical navigation or as an optical platform to study bio-material interfaces. We collaborate closely with hospitals/surgeons to address fundamental questions in biological metabolism and tumor phenotype development using advanced optical techniques.
